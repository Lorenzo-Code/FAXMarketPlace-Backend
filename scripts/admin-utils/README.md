## ⚠️ Important Notes

### **Security Considerations**
- **These utilities directly access the database**
- **Use only in emergency situations**
- **Ensure MongoDB connection is secure**
- **Passwords are logged to console during testing**

### **Environment Requirements**
- **MongoDB connection** - Requires valid MONGO_URI in .env
- **Node.js dependencies** - Run `npm install` first
- **Environment variables** - Ensure .env file is properly configured

### **Usage Guidelines**

1. **Emergency Account Recovery**
   ```bash
   # User locked out and can't login
   node scripts/admin-utils/unlock-account.js user@example.com
   ```

2. **Password Reset Requests**
   ```bash
   # User forgot password or needs secure reset
   node scripts/admin-utils/reset-password.js user@example.com "TempPassword123!"
   ```

3. **Account Status Check**
   ```bash
   # Just want to see user details without making changes
   node scripts/admin-utils/unlock-account.js user@example.com
   ```

## 🔐 Security Best Practices

### **Before Running Utilities:**
1. ✅ Verify user identity through alternative means
2. ✅ Check if user requested the action
3. ✅ Document the reason for manual intervention
4. ✅ Ensure you have proper admin authorization

### **After Running Utilities:**
1. ✅ Notify user of the account changes
2. ✅ Recommend they change temporary passwords
3. ✅ Monitor account for suspicious activity
4. ✅ Log the administrative action

### **Alternative Methods:**

Before using command-line utilities, consider these alternatives:

1. **Slack Admin Bot** (Recommended)
   ```bash
   /user unlock user@example.com
   /security reset-password user@example.com
   ```

2. **Admin Panel** - Use web interface when available
3. **API Endpoints** - Use authenticated admin API calls

```bash
# Create a script to unlock multiple accounts
for email in "user1@example.com" "user2@example.com" "user3@example.com"
do
    echo "Unlocking $email..."
    node scripts/admin-utils/unlock-account.js "$email"
    sleep 2
done
```

### **Database Connection Issues:**
1. Check MONGO_URI in .env file
2. Verify MongoDB service is running
3. Test connection with: `node -e "require('mongoose').connect(process.env.MONGO_URI).then(() => console.log('Connected')).catch(console.error)"`

### **Utility Errors:**
- **User not found**: Script lists all available users
- **Invalid password**: Shows specific validation errors
- **Database errors**: Check MongoDB logs and connection
